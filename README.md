# SchedulePlanner

Howdy! This will be an app to help people in school manage their exams.

Features hopefully will include:
- Create exams and view on a calendar.
- View past exams results, stats and averages.


This app uses Caldroid (https://github.com/roomorama/Caldroid), available for use under MIT license

Minimum Android version required: 4.4.2 for compatibility with Caldroid.
